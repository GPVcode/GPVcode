About Me:
Education is not about what you put into the student, but what you can bring out of them. After discovering the superpower of effective learning, I intuitively pointed this ability toward coding and never stopped coding ever since. The best part about building things is developing a process and becoming fully immersed in it. As a software engineer with a background in business and a passion for education, solving real customer problems with a business justification and providing impactful solutions are attractive.
