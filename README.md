## Summary
Education is not about what you put into the student but what you can bring out of them. After discovering the superpower of effective learning, I intuitively pointed this ability toward coding and never looked back. The best part about building and problem-solving is identifying a process and becoming fully immersed in it. As a software engineer with a background in business, a passion for education and personal development, solving real customer problems with a business justification and providing impactful solutions are attractive.
